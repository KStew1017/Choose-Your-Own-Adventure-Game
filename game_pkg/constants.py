WORLD_BACK_STORY = """
***************************************************************************************

For the best experience, I suggest looking at this map of the world.
Map of Iomore: https://i.imgur.com/TgzrL8k.jpg

Iomore is a fantasy world home to 3 main factions, the Creans (Humans), the 
Drorants (Orcs), and the Eldalian (Elves).

The Creans inhabit the landmass in the center of the map above called Icrea, 
which is home to a vast number of biomes, from the Frozen Fingers north of The 
Shield, to Exiles Mesa south of The Guardians. Additionally, there are many 
towns in Icrea, the most notable being Alryne which serves as the Capital.

The Eldalian inhabit the easternmost landmass called Imaira, which to the north 
has the largest supply of gold in the known world, and to the south has 
beautiful lush forests with unique and colorful flora. Hwen is the Capital of 
Imaira and is also the most populated city in the known world.

The kingdoms of Icrea and Imaira have a difficult relationship which they 
navigate. They both are great trading partners with each other in modern times, 
with Imaira supplying gold and other minerals, and Icrea supplying food and 
building materials. However, the extent of their relationship ends there. A 
brutal conflict in the past between the two destroyed any hope that they would 
ever be able to cooperate together again. Yet, after the conflict and during a 
period of immense hardship for both kingdoms, a special meeting was held 
between the leaders of each kingdom to restore their relationship in some 
capcaity, meaning trade. From then on, trading has benefitted both kingdoms but 
they do not interact any more than this.

The Drorants inhabit the landmass called Ikora which can be seen in the 
southwest corner of the map. Their capital city is Ozdror and is located in the 
desert on the banks of the Bay of Dalry. At the center of the bay is a giant 
pyramid they call Doz Ora, which seems to be a site of great significance. To 
the south of the desert is a vast wasteland beyond a large mountain range which 
is uncharted. Unlike the Creans and Eldalians, the Drorants are completely 
isolated from the others and are considered enemies by both.

GAME_BACK_STORY = """
**************************************************************************************

You are an exile living in Skull Rock on Exiles Mesa.

A bounty by the Eldalian Leader has been placed on the leader of a pirate crew 
which has taken over the Satalos military outpost on Tol Namma. The Eldalian Leader 
has promised gold and permanent residence in Hwen to whoever is able to free Satalos 
from the pirates occupation.

After catching word of this bounty, you have decided to embark on the mission to 
complete it.
"""

LOOT_SHIPWRECK = """
**************************************************************************************

Before you embark on your journey to Tol Namma, you remember an old shipwreck on the 
beaches of the southern tip of Exiles Mesa. There could possibly be loot there to 
better prepare you for your journey ahead.
"""

LOOT_SHIPWRECK_YES_1 = """
After rummaging through the old shipwreck you found something!
"""

EMBARK = """
**************************************************************************************

You and a group of willing participants have accepted to complete the task at hand, 
and have set sail. Good Luck!
"""

PIRATE_SHIP = """
**************************************************************************************

Uh Oh!

After a few days at sea, you see a pirate ship travelling in your path. You have 
the option to sail around them without conflict, or to confront them. If you sail 
around them you will avoid any fighting that could take a toll on your armor and 
health, but remember, you could also win and get better weapons or armor!
"""

LAND_ON_TOL_NAMMA = """
**************************************************************************************

After days at sea, you and your bounty hunting party have finally made it to Tol 
Namma. In order to get to Satalos, which is where the Pirate Leader is located, 
you must fight through the jungle against other pirates. Yet, you do have the 
option to dock on either the northern or southern peninsula of the island.

Depending on your choice, the type of enemies and events you encounter will be 
different!
"""

NORTH_PIRATE = """
**************************************************************************************

Shortly after your arrival to the Northern peninsula you come across a Pirate Scouting 
the jungle alone. Because he hasn't seen you yet, you have the option to either let 
him pass or take him out.

If you let him pass you will not risk taking any major damage, but you also won't get 
any loot he may have!
"""

NORTH_BRUTE = """
**************************************************************************************

After your encounter with the Pirate Scout, you come to a passage in the mountains 
that is guarded by a Pirate Brute. Unfortunately, there is no way around him so you 
must defeat him to continue.
"""

NORTH_VOLCANO = """
**************************************************************************************

With daylight running out and supplies dwindling, you come across a lava field at the 
base of an active volcano. There seems to be a safe pathway going around, but it 
will take you double the time than it would crossing the lava field.

If you do cross the lava field there is a chance you could take some damage, but 
you could also find loot!
"""

NORTH_VOLCANO_LAVA = """
**************************************************************************************

While crossing through the lava field you see something shimmering on the ground. 
While going to see what it is you are hurt by lava (-20 HP)! Thankfully it didn't hurt too 
much.

When you finally get to the source of the shimmering you find something!
"""

SOUTH_PIRATE = """
**************************************************************************************

Before docking on the island, you notice a Pirate camp near the shore. You could 
either fight them or dock farther down the shore and avoid conflict at this point.
"""

SOUTH_BRUTE = """
**************************************************************************************

After your encounter with the Pirate Scout, you come to a passage in the mountains 
that is guarded by a Pirate Brute. Unfortunately, there is no way around him so you 
must defeat him to continue.
"""

SOUTH_BRUTE_2 = """
**************************************************************************************

You have successfully made it to Satalos! But there is a Brute Pirate guarding the 
entrance to the fort. You must defeat him to gain access into the fort.
"""

PIRATE_LEADER = """
**************************************************************************************

You have finally made it to the Pirate Leader!

He is much harder to defeat than the previous enemies you have encountered, but the 
reward for defeating him is you freedom from Exiles Mesa and a permanent home in 
Hwen.

This is your final chance to use and health potions you have. Good Luck!"""

COMPLETE_GAME = """
**************************************************************************************

Congratulations!

You have defeated the Pirate Leader at the Satalos outpost on Tol Namma.

The Eldalian leader has recognized your success in completing his bounty and has 
granted you permanent residence in Hwen!
